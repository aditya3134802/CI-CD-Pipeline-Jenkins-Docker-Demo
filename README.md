# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker

This repository demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation using Jenkins and Docker for automated building, testing, and deployment of applications.

## Overview

This project showcases the integration of modern DevOps tools to create a streamlined CI/CD workflow:

- **Jenkins** for continuous integration and delivery orchestration
- **Docker** for containerization and consistent deployment environments
- **Pipeline-as-Code** using Jenkinsfile for version-controlled pipeline definitions
- **Multi-environment deployment** (Development, Staging, Production)

```

## CI/CD Workflow

1. **Code Commit**: Developer pushes code to repository
2. **Build**: Jenkins pulls code and builds the application
3. **Test**: Automated tests are executed
4. **Analysis**: Code quality and security scanning
5. **Containerization**: Application is packaged into Docker image
6. **Push**: Image is pushed to container registry
7. **Deploy**: Application is deployed to target environment

## Jenkins Pipeline Stages

The Jenkinsfile defines a complete pipeline with the following stages:

- **Checkout**: Clone the repository
- **Build**: Compile application code
- **Test**: Run unit and integration tests
- **Static Analysis**: Perform code quality checks
- **Package**: Create Docker image
- **Publish**: Push Docker image to registry
- **Deploy to Dev**: Deploy to development environment
- **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests
- **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy to staging environment
- **Acceptance Tests**: Run acceptance tests
- **Deploy to Production**: Deploy to production environment
- **Smoke Tests**: Verify production deployment

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins server
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Docker registry (DockerHub, ECR, etc.)
- Access to deployment environments

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Configure Jenkins with required plugins
3. Set up necessary credentials in Jenkins
4. Create a Jenkins pipeline job pointing to the Jenkinsfile
5. Trigger the pipeline manually or configure webhooks for automatic triggers

## Jenkins Configuration

The following plugins are recommended:

- Pipeline
- Docker Pipeline
- Git Integration
- Pipeline Utility Steps
- Blue Ocean (for improved UI)
- Credentials Binding
